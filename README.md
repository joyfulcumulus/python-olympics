# Exploratory Analysis: 120 Years of Olympics

## Introduction
* Motivation: Since the 2024 Olympics in Paris is over, I thought it would be interesting to do an exploratory data analysis on Olympics data
* Objective: Gain familiarity with using Python libraries - Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

## Technologies Used
### Language
* Python

### Packages
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib

## Approach
* Data sanity check: for completeness, correctness (i.e. check for weird values). 
* Data cleaning: Treat values (e.g. recode Year data) so that dataset is suitable for analysing
* Data inquiry: Come up with some interesting questions that I would like to know about the Olympics
* Data analysis: Plan which techniques to answer the questions I came up with and apply them

## Learning Points


## Further Development
* The geographic participation of the Olympics could be displayed using geospatial techniques instead of using bar charts
* To investigate how to use geospatial data packages in subsequent iterations (e.g. Kepler GL, geopandas)
